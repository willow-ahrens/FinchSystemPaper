\section{Related Work}

The related work on array languages and libraries, both for dense and structured computation, spans several areas.
%
We highlight these works based on if they are a library or language vs. if they are dense or more general.

\paragraph{Dense Libraries:} There are many well known libraries that specialize in dense computations, exemplified by BLAS, though several BLAS routines are specialized to symmetric, hermitian, and triangular matrices~\cite{Anderson1999}.
%
This pattern is carried over into well known dense array libraries that use BLAS, exemplified by Numpy.

\paragraph{Structured Libraries:}

Many libraries support BLAS plus a few sparse array types, typically CSR, CSC, BCSR, and COO.
%
Examples include Scipy, PETSc, Armadillo, and Eigen~\cite{virtanen2020scipy, abhyankarpetsc, Rumengan2021, eigenweb}.
%
Several of these libraries also feature some graph or mesh algorithms built on sparse matrices, which represent other sparse structures.
%
GraphBlas perhaps exemplifies this pattern with support for many sparse matrix operations on a variety of formats~\cite{kepner2016mathematical} although a variety of other graph libraries adopt a similar approach such as LAgraph~\cite{mattson2019lagraph}
