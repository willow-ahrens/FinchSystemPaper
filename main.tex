\begin{abstract}
From FORTRAN to Numpy, arrays have revolutionized how we express computation.  Arrays are the highest-performing datastructure with a long history of investment and innovation, from hardware support to compiler technology.  However, arrays can only handle dense rectilinear integer grids. Real world arrays often contain underlying structure, such as sparsity, runs of repeated values, or symmetry. We describe a compiler, Finch, which adapts existing programs and interfaces to the structure and sparsity of the inputs. Finch enables programmers to capture complex, real-world data scenarios with the same productivity they expect from dense arrays. Our approach enables new loop optimizations across multiple domains, unifying techniques such as sparse tensors, databases, and lossless compression.

\section{Introduction}

%- Fortran supported lots of control structures, no data structures, just dense arrays.
%
%- We tried to emulate complex data using only dense arrays but with complicated control structures.
%
%- Recently, people tried to build frameworks to support structured data, but gave up a lot of program side
%
%- Weâ€™re bringing these together, both need to work together.
\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A rich structured array programming language with for-loops
and complex control flow constructs at the same level of productivity
of dense arrays. To our knowledge, the Finch programming language is the first
to support if-conditions, early breaks, and multiple left hand sides over
structured data, as well as complex accesses such as affine indexing or scatter/gather.
\item More complex array structures than ever before. A complete level-by-level
structure-description language for expressing the structure of data
hierarchically. The first such set of formats to efficiently capture banded,
triangular, run-length-encoded, or sparse datasets, and any combination thereof.
\item The Finch compiler specializes programs to data structures in a
predictable, deterministic approach, making it easier to search the complex
space of programs and datastructures to find an appropriate fit for a given
application. The tensor interface makes it easy to extend Finch to new level
formats. A unique tensor lifecycle model enables polymorphism by analyzing the
appropriate stages to insert simple, overloadable, interface functions such as
initialization or finalization. 

\item We evaluate the productivity of our language in several case studies,
showing that Finch can be used to accelerate a wide range of applications, 
from classic operations such as spmv and spgemm, to more complex applications such as image processing and graph analytics.
We also demonstrate how Finch can fuse high-level operations to achieve a significant speedup over non-fused kernels. Additionally, as a case study, a high-level array programming language and fusion interface for
operations such as map, broadcast, or reduce that can be compiled to efficient
code using the previous loop-level abstractions.
%\item A complete set of level formats for expressing data patterns hierarchically in FiberTree-style decompositions. The first such set of formats to efficiently capture banded, triangular, run-length-encoded, or sparse-run-length-encoded datasets. The formats capture many use cases, from random updates to sequential construction.
%\item The Finch array language, mirroring simple for-loops with imperative code blocks and if-conditions. The first array programming language for the above data formats to support multiple outputs, affine indexing, and imperfectly-nested loops.
%\item Tensor lifecycles, a simple constraint on tensor reads and writes that elegantly restricts Finch programs to avoid complex data dependencies, and enables tensor polymorphism by providing implementers with well-defined functions to overload.
%\item Wrapper Tensors which modify existing datastructures and recombine them to support new patterns, such as affine indexing, padding, transposition, and slicing.
%\item Wrapper Levels which modify existing datastructures and enabling complex features such as atomic updates or contiguous versus separate allocation.
%\item We define the first mappings from the existing pydata/sparse array api high-level operations to low level finch notation

\subsection{Data-Driven Performance Engineering}
\subsubsection{Sparse-Sparse Matrix Multiply}

Examples that demonstrate performance engineering in a datastructure-driven model

\subsubsection{SpMV}
Finch provides many flexible level formats to efficiently capture a variety of patterns in datasets, encompassing both the structure and type of data. More specifically, these formats can represent banded, triangular, run-length-encoded, blocked, hashed, and boolean data, as well as several other formats. Finch also provides the control flow necessary to manipulate the order in which data in these flexible level formats is read and written, enabling us to take advantage of multiple structural patterns concurrentlyâ€”for example, we can exploit both sparsity and symmetry by using a sparse level format and restricting data reads to one triangle of a matrix. % I'm not sure if the right place for this is here - maybe should come earlier?

Structure in data arises both naturally, due to the chemical and physical properties of matter, and artificially via mathematical operations that induce particular patterns. Closely tailoring a storage format to a particular data pattern enables us to reduce the amount of stored values, make data accesses more efficient, and take advantage of spatial locality, resulting in more performant code.

The sparse matrix-vector multiplication kernel is a common operation in sparse linear algebra with many applications including conjugate gradients, graph algorithms, numerical analysis, and neural networks. The wide range of applications unsurprisingly results in a wide range of types of datasets making it an effective kernel to demonstrate the utility of having flexible data formats. In this case study, we highlight a few different Finch formats and the performance effects of conforming a datasetâ€™s structure with its storage format, which Finch's datastructure-driven model enables us to do.

We compare Finchâ€™s performance to that of TACO, SuiteSparseGraphBLAS, and Juliaâ€™s standard library.  We test using sparse matrices from a large selection of datasets spanning several previous papers: the datasets used by Vuduc et al. to test the OSKI interface [cite], Ahrens et al. to test a variable block row format partitioning strategy [cite], and Kjolstad et al. to test the TACO library [cite]. In addition, we also created several synthetic matrices containing bands or blocks of varying sizes as well as a permutation matrix to encapsulate a few additional use cases. The dense vector is randomly generated. We depict the performance of SpMV across the aforementioned tools and compare to the fastest Finch format for that particular dataset in Figures 1 and 2. 

\subsubsection{SparseList Format}
\subsubsection{SparseVBL Format}
The SparseVBL format is similar to the SparseList format, but contiguous fibers are stored together as blocks. Thus, it is most worthwhile to use when the matrix has a blocked structureâ€”i.e. where there tend to be stretches of consecutive nonzero values. We found that the SparseVBL format performed the best for matrices with a clear block structure (list specific matrices) or an imperfect blocked structure (list specific matrices). 
\subsubsection{Pattern Format}
\subsubsection{Symmetric SpMV}
Finch enables us to exploit symmetry in the sparse matrix of the SpMV kernel by providing the capabilities to reuse memory reads and insert control flow logic to restrict iterations to either the lower or upper triangle of the sparse matrix. We can apply this strategy with any level format. Every symmetric matrix in the SparseList and SparseList-Pattern formats has better performance when we use a Finch SpMV program that takes advantage of this symmetry. However, the regular Finch SpMV program has better performance for symmetric matrices than the symmetric Finch SpMV program for the other more specialized formats, likely because we need in-order accesses to fully capitalize on the specialized storage. Symmetric SpMV with the SparseList level format in Finch results in an average of 1.3x speedup over TACO and symmetric SpMV with the SparseList-Pattern format in Finch results in an average speedup of 1.15x over TACO . Notably, there is a 1.9x speedup for the HB/saylr4 matrix.
